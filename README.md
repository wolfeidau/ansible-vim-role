# vim

Pretty generic VIM setup for JS, node and golang.

## Example 

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: wolfeidau.vim, deploy_user: "markw", deploy_user_dir: "/Users/markw" }
